Aaand we are back!

From the 24th till the 26th of September GEOS brought a group of 34 Geomatics students to the city of Stuttgart for our annual trip to INTERGEO.
This world-leading trade fair for geodesy, geoinformation, and land management provided our students with incredible networking opportunities and insights into the latest industry innovations.
