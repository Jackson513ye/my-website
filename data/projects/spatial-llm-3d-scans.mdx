- Built a chatbot that converts free-form questions into intents and executable steps operating on indoor point clouds.
- Integrated language understanding with 2D–3D matching, lightweight segmentation, and geometric queries to locate objects, infer relations, and extract spatial attributes.
- Delivered concise answers with interactive views and auto-generated measurements for rapid exploration and repeatable data extraction.
