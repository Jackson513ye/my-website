## Summary

This research uses a dual-anchor (residence + workplace) framework and a cross-classified multilevel model on 965 commuters in Xi'an, this study measures commuting CO₂ as distance × mode-specific emission factors × traffic-condition weights and tests income heterogeneity; we find workplace contexts explain most variance, with higher parking density and higher job accessibility around workplaces associated with higher emissions, while bus-stop abundance and metro presence near workplaces reduce emissions, and living farther from the city center raises emissions; emissions are highly concentrated (top 10% generate ~67% of commuting CO₂) and effects are generally stronger for middle-to-high-income commuters, implying policy levers should prioritize workplace-side transit investment and parking management alongside income-sensitive targeting.

## Introduction

Urban commuting CO₂ in dense cities is jointly shaped by the built environment (BE) around both residences and workplaces. This study asks:

1. How do residential- and workplace-area BE jointly affect commuting CO₂?
2. Do these effects differ by income?

We implement a dual-anchor approach and explicitly test income-based disparities.

## Methodology

### Data & Sample

A stratified household travel survey in Xi'an (Sept–Nov 2021) yields 965 employed commuters with demographics, attitudes, preferences, perceived BE, and one-day travel diaries. Income is discretized as annual household income (AHI): LI (≤ CNY 60,000) and MHI (> CNY 60,000).

### Outcome: Weighted Commuting CO₂ (WCE)

For commuter $i$ using mode $n$:

$$
WCE_i = D_i \times F_n \times C_i
$$

where $D_i$ is residence–workplace distance, $F_n$ is the mode-specific emission factor, and $C_i$ is a traffic-condition correction determined by urban zones. Non-motorized modes are set to zero.

#### Table A. Mode-specific CO₂ emission factors (used in $F_n$)

| Mode | Emission Factor (g CO₂/km) |
|------|----------------------------|
| Private car / Taxi | 233.1 |
| Urban bus | 26.0 |
| Coach | 20.3 |
| Metro | 20.9 |
| E-bike / Walk / Bicycle | 0 |

#### Table B. Traffic-condition correction factors by urban zone (used in $C_i$)

| Zone | Car/Taxi Speed | Car/Taxi Weight | Bus Speed | Bus Weight |
|------|----------------|------------------|-----------|------------|
| Inside the city wall | 19.05 | 1.71 | 15.76 | 1.65 |
| City wall–2nd Ring | 20.99 | 1.54 | 17.36 | 1.51 |
| 2nd Ring–Ring Expwy | 29.84 | 1.06 | 24.68 | 1.04 |
| Outside Ring Expwy | 31.50 | 1.00 | 26.05 | 1.00 |

### Explanatory Variables: Dual-Anchor Built Environment

We measure BE around residence and workplace using a 15-minute cyclist circle and the 5D framework (Density, Diversity, Design, Distance to transit, Destination accessibility).

- **Land-use mix (LUM)** via entropy:

$$
LUM_i = -\frac{\sum_a p_a \ln p_a}{\ln N}
$$

where $p_a$ is the share of land-use class $a$ in region $i$.

- **Job accessibility index (JAI)** at Jiedao scale:

$$
JAI_i = \frac{W_i + \sum_{j=1}^{S} \frac{W_j}{d_{ij}^2}}{WP_i}
$$

where $W$ is job supply, $WP$ is working-age population, and $d_{ij}$ are centroid distances within 4 km.

- **Transit variables**: bus-stop count and a binary metro presence (≥ 1 station) within each circle.
- **Design** includes parking-lot density.
- **Destination accessibility** includes distance to city center (Zhonglou), nearest commercial facility, and grade school.

### Modeling: Cross-Classified Multilevel Model (CCMM)

Let commuter $i$ live in residence community $r$ and work in workplace community $w$.

**Level-1 (individual):**

$$
WCE_{irw} = \phi + \alpha_r + \alpha_w + \beta_S^T X_i + e_{irw}, \quad e_{irw} \sim N(0, \sigma_{irw}^2)
$$

**Level-2 (residence):**

$$
\alpha_r = \beta_R^T X_r + e_r, \quad e_r \sim N(0, \sigma_r^2)
$$

**Level-2 (workplace):**

$$
\alpha_w = \beta_W^T X_w + e_w, \quad e_w \sim N(0, \sigma_w^2)
$$

**Variance attribution (ICCs):**

$$
ICC_{res} = \frac{\sigma_r^2}{\sigma_{irw}^2 + \sigma_r^2 + \sigma_w^2}
$$

$$
ICC_{work} = \frac{\sigma_w^2}{\sigma_{irw}^2 + \sigma_r^2 + \sigma_w^2}
$$

## Results

### R1. Distribution of emissions

Commuting CO₂ is highly concentrated: roughly 10% of commuters generate about 67% of total commuting CO₂. MHI commuters emit over 3× LI commuters on average; the disparity is driven primarily by mode choice (greater private car/taxi share), not distance.

### R2. Empty CCMMs (variance decomposition)

Workplace context dominates in the full sample: $ICC_{work} = 0.731$ vs. $ICC_{res} = 0.078$. The combined (res + work) ICC is higher for MHI (0.786) than LI (0.416), implying BE explains more for MHI commuters.

#### Table C. Empty-model variance components and ICCs

| Group | $\sigma_r^2$ | $\sigma_w^2$ | $\sigma_{irw}^2$ | $ICC_{res}$ | $ICC_{work}$ | N |
|-------|--------------|--------------|------------------|-------------|--------------|---|
| Whole sample | 128023.1 | 1192641.1 | 311567.3 | 0.078 | 0.731 | 965 |
| LI | 79081.8 | 85566.2 | 230761.6 | 0.200 | 0.216 | 232 |
| MHI | 130651.8 | 1306601.5 | 391232.8 | 0.071 | 0.715 | 733 |

### R3. Main effects (BE → WCE)

After controls (demographics, attitudes, preferences, perceived BE), workplace-area BE shows the strongest associations:

- **Parking-lot density (workplace)** → higher WCE
- **Bus-stop count (workplace)** → lower WCE
- **Metro presence (workplace)** → lower WCE
- **Job accessibility (workplace)** → higher WCE
- **Distance to city center (residence)** → positive: farther from center ⇒ higher WCE

### R4. Income heterogeneity (interactions with AHI)

Effects generally amplify with income:

- **Residence distance to city center × AHI**: larger reductions when living closer to center among higher-income commuters (i.e., stronger benefit of centrality at higher income)
- **Workplace transit × AHI**: bus-stop count and metro presence reduce WCE more strongly at higher incomes
- **Workplace job accessibility × AHI**: more positive association at higher incomes

#### Table D. Selected BE × AHI interactions (direction and significance)

| Interaction term | Direction (MHI vs. LI) | Significance (p) |
|------------------|------------------------|------------------|
| $d_{center\_r} \times AHI$ | positive | < 0.05 |
| $num_{bus\_w} \times AHI$ | negative | < 0.05 |
| $metro_w \times AHI$ | negative | 0.10 to 0.001 |
| $den_{park\_w} \times AHI$ | positive | * to ** |
| $ja_w \times AHI$ | positive | * to *** |

## Conclusions

1. **Workplace-area BE is the primary lever**: managing parking supply and strengthening workplace-proximate transit (especially metro) are robust strategies to cut commuting CO₂ in dense cities.

2. **Income matters**: many BE effects are stronger for higher-income commuters; targeted TOD and calibrated parking restraint in job centers can deliver larger absolute reductions with equity-minded transit coverage.

3. **Residential centrality still matters**: living farther from the center raises emissions; avoiding unchecked suburbanization or pursuing polycentric structures can help.
