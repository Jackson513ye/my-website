- Built a teacher–student pipeline that fuses ENVI-met simulation outputs with gradient-boosted models to predict thermal comfort from 3D tree structures at street scale.
- Integrated LiDAR and inventory data to derive tree configurations and minimal urban-form controls for robust generalisation across districts, climates, and street geometries.
- Produced variable importances, practical thresholds, and interaction effects to generate context-specific design guidance for optimising tree configurations.
