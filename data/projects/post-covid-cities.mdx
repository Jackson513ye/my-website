* Investigated the shifts in urban travel behaviours post-COVID by leveraging social media (Twitter) data to capture pre- and post-pandemic mobility trends.
* Developed a framework integrating SVM for data cleansing with LDA for topic modelling to extract travel patterns.
* Uncovered changes—declining work/entertainment trips and rising healthcare mobility—and mapped spatial–temporal variations to inform urban planning.
